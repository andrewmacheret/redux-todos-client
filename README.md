# redux-todos-client

A react redux todo list in a browser that uses a backend at localhost:3001, meant to be run with [andrewmacheret/redux-todos-server](https://github.com/andrewmacheret/redux-todos-server).

It's currently very ugly because I haven't bothered to add any CSS. This was a learning project. But the code is pretty.

Fork of [https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos), which did not include a backend at all.

To run:

  ```bash
  npm install
  
  npm start
  ```
